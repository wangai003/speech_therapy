## Introduction

Welcome to the **Speech Therapy **, a heartfelt digital companion dedicated to supporting individuals with speech disabilities. We understand that communication is a fundamental part of human connection, yet many individuals face challenges that hinder their ability to express themselves. Our mission is to bridge this gap by providing accessible, compassionate resources and support tailored specifically for those with speech disabilities.

At the Speech Therapy Chatbot, we believe that everyone deserves to communicate their thoughts, feelings, and ideas confidently. With our chatbot, users can embark on a journey towards improved communication skills in a safe, engaging, and supportive environment.

## Identifying the Gap

Speech disabilities affect millions of people, creating barriers not only in communication but also in self-expression and social interaction. Traditional therapy options can often be expensive, time-consuming, and may not provide the ongoing support individuals need outside of scheduled sessions. 

**The gap we aim to fill:**  
Many individuals lack easy access to resources and community support, leading to feelings of isolation and frustration. The Speech Therapy Chatbot serves as a continuous source of encouragement and guidance, ensuring that individuals can practice and develop their speech skills anytime, anywhere.

## Target Audience

- **Individuals with Speech Disabilities**: Those seeking guidance, resources, and community support in overcoming their communication challenges.

- **Speech Therapists**: Professionals seeking supplementary resources for their clients and opportunities for engagement outside of therapy sessions.
